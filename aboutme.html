        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Emma Harmon; on my Insta I go by "Stargirl". I am a self-taught artist with a focus on human figures. I especially love to create my own versions of existing characters and figures, such as Danny Phantom and the Chipmunks.</p>
        <p>I've been interested in art since I was a child. I created solely in physical medium until about 2 years ago when I started working in digital art as well. I love to work in both for different reasons - but I HATE realism! My look is very stylized and youthful, with a focus on COLORS!</p>
        <p>My dream is to one day have my own animated show, as well as to work on other projects. But whether or not it becomes my career, art will always be my favorite way to lose myself for hours - that and falling in love with fictional characters!</p>
